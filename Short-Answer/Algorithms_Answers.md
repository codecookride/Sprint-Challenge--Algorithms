#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)Linear O(n) the number of operations grows steadily with the input size.


b)log-linear O(n log (n)) outer for loop would be linear but the iner while loop would be logarithmic.


c)
Linear O(n) the only operation being done is to add 2 and reduce bunnies by 1 on each recursive call

## Exercise II

I would use a Binary search, 

If we start in the middle we can drop the egg and if it breaks, we eliminate all the floors above, then we move to the middle and repeat untill we find the sweet spot. 

It would have a logarithmic Runtime complexity because it halves the data set each Time through.
